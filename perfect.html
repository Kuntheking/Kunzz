            I might never be your knight in shinin' armor
            I might never be the one you take home to mother
            And I might never be the one who brings you flowers
            But I can be the one, be the one tonight
            When I first saw you
            From across the room
            I could tell that you were curious, oh, yeah
            Girl, I hope you're sure
            What you're looking for
            'Cause I'm not good at making promises
            But if you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
            And if you like having secret little rendezvous
            If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn't do
            Then baby, I'm perfect
            Baby, I'm perfect for you
            And if you like midnight driving with the windows down
            And if you like going places we can't even pronounce
            If you like to do whatever you've been dreaming about
            Then baby, you're perfect
            Baby, you're perfect
            So let's start right now
            I might never be the hands you put your heart in
            Or the arms that hold you any time you want them
            But that don't mean that we can't live here in the moment
            'Cause I can be the one you love from time to time
            When I first saw you
            From across the room
            I could tell that you were curious, oh, yeah
            Girl, I hope you're sure
            What you're looking for
            'Cause I'm not good at making promises
            But if you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
            And if you like having secret little rendezvous
            If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn't do
            Then baby, I'm perfect
            Baby, I'm perfect for you
            And if you like midnight driving with the windows down
            And if you like going places we can't even pronounce
            If you like to do whatever you've been dreaming about
            Then baby, you're perfect
            Baby, you're perfect
            So let's start right now
            And if you like cameras flashin' every time we go out
            Oh, yeah
            And if you're looking for someone to write your breakup songs about
            Baby, I'm perfect
            Baby, we're perfect
            If you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
            And if you like having secret little rendezvous
            If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn't do
            Then baby, I'm perfect

            Baby, you're perfect
