            I'm only one call away

            I'll be there to save the day

            Superman got nothing on me
            
            I'm only one call away

            Call me, baby, if you need a friend

            I just wanna give you love

            C'mon, c'mon, c'mon

            Reaching out to you, so take a chance

            No matter where you go, know you're not alone

            I'm only one call away

            I'll be there to save the day

            Superman got nothing on me

            I'm only one call away

            Come along with me and don't be scared

            I just wanna set you free

            C'mon, c'mon, c'mon

            You and me can make it up, anyway

            For now, we can stay here for a while

            Cause you know, I just wanna see your smile

            No matter where you go, know you're not alone

            I'm only one call away

            I'll be there to save the day

            Superman got nothing on me

            I'm only one call away

            When you're weak I'll be strong

            I'm gonna keep holding on

            Now don't you worry, it won't be long

            Darling, if you feel like hope is gone

            Just run into my arms

            I'm only one call away

            I'll be there to save the day

            Superman got nothing on me

            I'm only one, I'm only one call away

            I'm only one call away

            I'll be there to save the day

            Superman got nothing on me

            I'm only one call away
            
            I'm only one call away
